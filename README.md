# donut_plots_with_subgroups
Several generalized scripts for making donut plots that include subgroups

Click on `launch binder` badge above to spin up a sesion where you can make plots.

*These scripts/approaches take dataframes or tabular text forms.* 

If you have data as a table from elsewhere you can convert it/export into tabular text as tab-separated or comma-separated form and that can be used as input by any of the approaches here.

## Demonstration notebooks

The intent is that there be (at least) **four** notebooks:
The **first** notebook that opens in the active session demonstrates a script that makes it easy to make a plot like the following from a dataframe.  
Typical results (**two separate images shown**):

The **second** notebook shows the underlying code that runs that script and makes a plot like shown in [the example from The Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/163-donut-plot-with-subgroups/).  
Typical result:

The **third** notebook shows how to make a plot that includes a summary of the subgroups on the left with a plot with the subgroups on the right.  
Typical result:

![typical_nb3](imgs/nb3_example.png)

The **fourth** notebook shows how to make a plot much like the third notebook produces; however, this script is specialized for binary data for the subgroups, i.e., they can only have two resulting states at most.  
Typical result:
